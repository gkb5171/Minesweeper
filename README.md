# Minesweeper
Final Project in Java Sophomore year of college, my personal first ever full functioning Java Application. It is a simplified replica of the game minesweeper 

The tiles used to create the field were Jbuttons added to a grid layout in Java Swing. When a button was clicked the the color of the button would match the background
and the text of the Jbutton would turn into the number to match the number of bombs surrounding it.

The Bombs in the game are pre determined randomly at the generation of the gameboard stage (which is right after the user decides the difficulty) the non-bomb tiles were 
then assigned their value after the randomization of the bomb tiles.

The game is played the same way as traditional minesweeper. I am also open to positive criticism to impove/enhance my code.
